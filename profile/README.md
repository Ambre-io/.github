### Company

Ambre.io offers work and entertainment technology solutions.

After a decade of crafting code, this clear vision dawned on me: if I go at my own pace and take the time to do things well then I'm having fun. When I have fun I create software that meets a specific need in an optimized and beautiful way. By ricochet effect there are fewer bugs and it is more ecological because only the carefully knitted necessities are loaded.

A focus is placed on simplicity, intelligence, power and elegance.

### Goals

***Short Term***

Obtain stable and sufficient regular income to devote myself entirely to projects.

***Middle Term***

Build cash machines in which humans are at the center and thrive.

***Long Term***

Use part of the money to create "frontline professions" companies in which employees would be paid 2 to 3 times more than the minimum wage. So that people who have these roles also have a decent life with more access. Which will contribute to societal rebalance.

### Sponsors

I understood what I sincerely love and I also understood that I couldn't achieve it entirely alone.

In reality I need you.

Both on the financial aspect which has a direct implication but also on the human aspect. I testify, it feels good to feel supported!

Feel free to consider becoming a Sponsor on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ambre-io) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=117579457).

Thank you for your time, energy and consideration.
